# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Project
# Text Data Analysis and Preprocessing
###  Project Description
-  This project applies Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze customer reviews. It aims to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data to understand customer sentiment, preferences, and overall experiences. The project utilizes various NLP methods to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the review data.

###  Features
-  Text Cleaning: Removal of unnecessary elements like punctuations, HTML tags, URLs, and emojis from review texts.
-  Lemmatization: Reduction of words to their base form for better text analysis.
-  Textual Analysis: Examination of word patterns, frequency of stop words, and URL occurrences in reviews.
-  Data Visualization: Graphical representation of analysis results using matplotlib and seaborn.

###  Dataset Description
-  The dataset was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawlfeeds/trustpilot-reviews-dataset) and comprises customer reviews, each with a title and text body. These reviews are also labeled with ratings, from 1 to 5, providing a preliminary basis for sentiment analysis.
